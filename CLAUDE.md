## How this project is organized

- `.cef/` — CEF configuration and memory. Start here.
  - `manifest.yaml` — enabled engines, skills, MCP servers, and project metadata.
  - `memory.md` — persistent project memory. **Read it before making decisions; update it after significant work.**
  - `project.json` / `runtime.json` — machine-readable project and runtime configuration.
- `app/` — routes and pages. `components/` — reusable UI. `features/` — feature modules.
- `lib/` — utilities and clients. `hooks/` — React hooks. `types/` — shared types.
- `content/` — content and copy (including legal pages under `content/legal/`). `docs/` — documentation.
- `tests/` — tests. `docker/` — container support. `public/` — static assets.

## Conventions

- Follow the enabled engines' standards. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), security, performance,
  and legal are **floors** — never trade them away.
- Prefer server-first rendering; keep client JavaScript minimal and justified.
- Every page ships its empty, loading, and error states. No placeholder content.
- Legal documents in this project are **drafts** and must be reviewed by a qualified legal
  professional before publication.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Quality gate

`npm run verify` runs every automated gate — types, lint, formatting, and
tests — in the order CEF reviews them. Run it before reporting work complete; a failing gate
means the work is not done.
